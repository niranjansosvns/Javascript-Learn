    Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed. 

 

Example 1:

Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
Example 2:

Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
Example 3:

Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
Example 4:

Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]

        A lot of the solutions I've seen look unecessarily complex. This is what I came up with - am I missing something in terms of efficiency? The sort is clearly the most expensive step, and O(nlog(n)) seems pretty good to me...
        /**
 * @param {string[]} products
 * @param {string} searchWord
 * @return {string[][]}
 */
const suggestedProducts = (products, searchWord) => {
    let res = [];
    products = products.sort();
    for (let i = 0; i < searchWord.length; i++) { // for each letter in the search term
        products = products.filter(p => p[i] === searchWord[i]); // filter out the words that don't have the same letter
        res.push(products.slice(0, (products.length < 3) ? products.length : 3)); // and push the top 3 (or fewer if there are fewer) into the suggestions
    }
    return res;
};
